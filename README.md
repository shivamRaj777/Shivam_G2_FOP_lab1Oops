# Shivam_G2_FOP_lab1Oops
This project is about generating an email along with the password for the respective user, using the concept of OOPS(interface, class, objects, super).
Basic input from the user to take the first name, and last name, and then generate email using first name and last name @ department"abc.com". 
Made use of a switch case for the selection of department for the user.
For password generation, I have used Java. util. random from string . Where string is a combination of uppercase + lowercase + special characters + digits from 0 to 9.
Prerequisite for this project - Eclipse IDE, Environment variable setup -JAVA_HOME for jdk. 
jdk must be above the 13 version.
